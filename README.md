# Course Search Application

A Spring Boot application that provides course search functionality using Elasticsearch with advanced filtering, sorting, fuzzy search, and autocomplete features.

---

## üöÄ Features

* üîç Full-text search with fuzzy matching on course titles and descriptions
* üéØ Multiple filters: category, type, age range, price range, and session dates
* ‚ÜïÔ∏è Sorting options: by upcoming sessions, price (ascending/descending)
* üìÑ Pagination support
* üß† Autocomplete suggestions for course titles
* üì¶ Bulk data indexing from JSON file

---

## üõ† Prerequisites

* Java 17 or higher
* Maven 3.6 or higher
* Docker and Docker Compose

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Start Elasticsearch

Start Elasticsearch using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Verify Elasticsearch is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9200
```

You should see a JSON response with cluster information.

### 2. Run the Spring Boot Application

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start at `http://localhost:8080` and will automatically:

* Connect to Elasticsearch
* Create the necessary indices
* Load sample course data from `src/main/resources/sample-courses.json`
